# Enchiridion of Product Design

See: [Progressive Enhancement](https://github.com/tarasowski/enchiridion/blob/master/006_enchiridion-of-html.md)

## Three Features or Less

* Product reviews are similar in that they focus on the "missing" features. 
* Those missing features are typically available in a variety of unsuccessfull competitng products, which
leads people to erroneously conclude that a successful product would necessarily have even more features.
* More features = better mindset is the reason why so many smart people are bad at product design.

* What is the right approach to new products:

> Pick three key attributes or features, get those things very very right, and then forget about everything else. 

* Those three attributes define the fundamental essense and value of the product -- the rest is noise.

* For example the original iPod was:
  1) small enough to fit in your pocket
  2) had enough storage to hild many hours of music
  3) easy to sync with your Mac
  
* That is, now wireless, no ability to edit playlists on the device, no support for Ogg, nothing but the essentials, well executed
  
* Gmail had similar approach
  1) it was fast
  2) stored all of your email (back when 4MB quotas were the norm)
  3) had an innovative interface based on conversations and search

* The secondary and teriary features were minimal or absent, no rich text composer, address book was implemented in two days and did almost nothing
  
* Other features can be added or improved later on, but if the basic product isn't compelling, adding more features won't save it.

> By focusing on only a feww core features in the first version, you are forced to find the true essense and value of the product.

* If your product needs "everything" in order to be good, then it's probably not very innovative (though it might be a nice upgrade to an exisiting product). 
* Put another way, if your product is great, it doesn`t need to be good.

* If you are creating a new product, what are the three (or fewer) features that will make it so great that you can cut or half-ass everything else? Are you focusing at least 80% of your effort on getting those three things right?
  
**Disclaimer: This advice probably only applies to consumer products (ones where the purcahser is also the user - this includes some business products). For markets that have purchasing processes with long list of feature requirements, you should probably just crank out as many features as possible and not waste time on simplicity or usability.**
