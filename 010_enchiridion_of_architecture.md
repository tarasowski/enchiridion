# Architectural Boundaries

Architecture defines a set of components of a system. How these components are arranged within a system. How these components communicate with each other. What kind of boundaries | exist between the components. We use boundaries | to separate components from each other that shouldn't know about each other. This gives us isolation within the system that makes the system robust on itself if component failure within the system happens. One component cannot crash the whole system.
